                <p>The present thesis was thereby applying Data Science helps monitoring structural health components in Applied Mechanics and Systems Research Laboratory (LASMAP) to predict and alert potential damages by using Physical informed neural network.Recently, PINN has demonstrated its effciency
                        by avoiding overfiting problem which result of insufficient data and the ability to draw the physic reality along with the probabilistic and mathematical view of a machine learning algorithm(in this case Arti-fcial neural network ). Combined both will lead to efficiently resolve physical problems that approximation and error reduction is critical to just being conclude by traditional machine learning approach.</p>

                    Data has became wide which is requiring more and more expertise. Insights couldnâ€™t be found if data are not present in an acceptable quality. Present cannot be possible without ensuring constantly they are at the right place and time.</br>
                    
                    Elaborating models fitting different case scenarios is meaningless if itâ€™s not involving diverse expertise leading to growth and impact.</br></br>

                        Before that I obtained my bachelor's degree from Faculty of Science of Gabes and recently graduated from
                        Istic Borj Cedria with a Msc in Data Science research focused.
                        As a freshman, I started a bachelor in biological sciences. I drop out shortly before the sophomore year.

        <h2>Area of Interest</h2>
        <p>My interest and areas of focus is the intersection between Data Science, Artificial intelligence along with Natural 
            Language processing (NLP), intelligent Systems, cybersecurity, and robotics.
            Believe or not, the new literacy is coding, data literacy. In the past, no longer ago when I was in high school it's admitted and believed that the 
            illiteracy came from not knowing speaking, writing, and reading in more than one language. Plus not being proficient in microsoft suite (word, excel or powerpoint).
            <br><br>
            Today, we're living on an evolving world. Hate it or not, the illiterate of the near future is one who can't keep up
            with updating his working tools. You guess it. We have seen that it has been disruption by Artificial intelligence (AI) in short period that we were not used to it. Most domains start to be irrelevant
            and  require more and more incorporation of new recipes. It's a no brainer the upskilling for oneself and being up to date shall be a long life goal. Thus, everyone
            could access the knowledge of this era without much hustle and thrive for much better future.

            <br><br>
            A part from tech world, I believe in non scarcity likely mindset. I reckon that a world that can ensure equity, rights and resources for 
            individuals is possible and ideal we all should aspire. It's scary to activate the survival mode, to be in maximal alert of everything that the 
            world we live in. Technology can help in outpassing humanity fears against dark alleys.
